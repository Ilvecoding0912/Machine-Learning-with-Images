# Machine-Learning-with-Images
A coursework based on multiple machine learning models and technologies with images.

The following two figures are the results from VAE, which are only a small part of this coursework.

**Note that there are still some prolems here, e.g. sampling from latent space of auto-encoder is not completely right, but it may be a good start. Users can refer to related papers or other repository for accurate operations; the complementation of convolution without using 'for-loop' is only compatible for squared images.**
