# Machine-Learning-with-Images
A coursework based on multiple machine learning models and technologies with images.

**Note that sampling from latent space of auto-encoder is not completely right, but it may be a good start. Users can refer to related papers or other repository.**

**Besides, the complementation of convolution without using 'for-loop' is only compatible for squared images.**
